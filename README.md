# HX-Optimization
This project showcases my work done for a summer internship sponsored by MathWorks, which aimed to validate the use of Simscape for sizing multiple components simultaneously. It includes a modified heat exchanger and pipe block which find the geometry for desired performance parameters. A multiobjective optimizer was used to find tradeoffs and streamline the design process.

The comments inside the code and model will allow you to start.

The completion of this project would not have been possible without the support of Dr Christopher Clark and Dr Lachlan Jardine, for which I am extremely grateful.
